## Responsive Wine Page

### I designed a responsive wine page with using Html,scss and javascript.

### A beautiful slogan appears on the first page. At the top there is a fix navbar and at the bottom left there is a phrase and circle showing our number of pages. Every time we scroll the page shifts to the right and our indicator changes. 

### There are buttons on the right and left of the page. The page can also be changed by pressing the buttons instead of scrolling.
